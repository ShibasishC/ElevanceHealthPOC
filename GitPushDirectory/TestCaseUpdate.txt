In the code above, I have modified the `printname` method to return a string instead of printing it, as it's easier to test functions that return values. The `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to run the same test function with different arguments. The `hasattr` function is used to check if an object has a given attribute. The `pytest.raises` context manager is used to check if a specific exception is raised.
