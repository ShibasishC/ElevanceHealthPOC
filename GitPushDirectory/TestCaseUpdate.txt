In the above code, I have modified the `printname` method to return a string instead of printing it, as it's easier to test functions that return their results. The `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to run the same test function with different arguments, which is useful for testing a function with a variety of inputs. The `pytest.raises` context manager is used to check that a certain exception is raised, which is useful for testing that a function correctly handles invalid input.
