    assert student.printname() == expected  # the printname method should return the full name

@pytest.mark.parametrize("fname, lname, year, expected", [

```

Note: The `printname` method in the `Person` and `Student` classes has been modified to return a string instead of printing it. This is because it's not straightforward to test print statements with pytest. By returning a string, we can easily compare the output of the method to the expected output.
