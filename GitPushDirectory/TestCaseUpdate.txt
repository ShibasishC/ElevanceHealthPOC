In this code, I've made a small modification to the `printname` method in both `Person` and `Student` classes to return the full name instead of printing it. This is to make it easier to test the method. The `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to run the same test function with different parameters, making the test cases more readable and maintainable.
